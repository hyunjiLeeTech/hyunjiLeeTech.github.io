### Introduction
This blog is for organizing all the results I have done in [Stage 1][Project Stage1] and Stage 2 ([Aarch64 profiling][Project Stage2] and [x86_64 profiling][Project Stage2-x86-64]). As I have found that the images I put on the blogs sometimes are not shown on the screen, I think this organization can be helpful for the readers to understand what the result of each stages. I put the links for each stage's results.

On the next blog, I will post what points I can optimize this project based on the profiling results.
