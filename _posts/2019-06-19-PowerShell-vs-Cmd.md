Similarity
1. Both provide a command-line environment
2. Bith allow the creation of scripts
3. Your old familiar Cmd.exe commands work in PowerShell
- dir (directory)
- ls (list)
- cls (clear the screen)
  
Difference
1. PowerShell
- object-based scripting language (makes dealing with command results very easy and efficient)
- Provides access to the .NET Framework the building blocks of Windows functionalities
- Provides the programming power and accessibility of an object oriented programming language in a scripting environment

2. Cmd
- provide a command-line interface for a very limited set of functionality
- text-based scripting environment (makes dealing with command results difficult)
- does not provice access to many aspects of the OS and applications
