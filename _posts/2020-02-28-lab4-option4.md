### Introduction
For lab 4, I can choose two options among four options. My team chose the first and fourth options which are adding calculator and screen colour selector. This post is for the fourth option "Screen Colour Selector". The instruction of option 4 is written below.

### Option 4: Screen Colour Selector Instruction
Create a subroutine which displays on the character display a list of colours available on the bitmapped display, one colour per line, with one of the names of the colours highlighted in reverse video (white on black). The user may use the up/down arrow keys to change the highlighted row. Return the user's selection as a number in the accumulator (A) register when they press Enter.
Using this subroutine, get a colour from the user, then fill the bitmap display with this colour, and allow the user to select a different colour.

#### 1. Design
##### 1.1. Pseudo Code
1) Initialize values
2) get the key (up/down key)
3) check whether the colour needs to be increased or decreased (compare the colour to #$00 (the first value) or #$0a (the last value))
4) print the characters on the screen
5) compare the value and check what option needs to be highlighted
6) paint the bit-mapped screen with the selected colour
7) go back to step 2 and repeat it

##### 1.2. variables
SCINIT        $ff81
CHROUT        $ffd2
COLOUR        $10
COLOUR_INDEX  $11
POINTER       $40
POINTER_H     $41
UP_KEY        $80
DOWN_KEY      $82

##### 1.3. Subroutines
- getKey: get the up/down key. When the user presses up/down key, it starts decrement_key or increment_key subroutine
- decrement_key: compare the previous selected colour value with #$01. When the previous selected colour is #$00, nothing happens and go back to the getKey subroutine. When it is not #$00, go to the decrement_colour subroutine
- decrement_colour: decrement colour value and go to the initialize_print subroutine
- increment_key: compare the previous selected colour value with #$0f. When the previous selected colour is #$0f, nothing happens and go back to the getKey subroutine. When it is not #$00, go to the increment_colour subroutine
- increment_colour: increment colour value and go to the initialize_print subroutine
- initialize_print: use SCINIT and initialize y value to 0
- title_write: write the title (Colours)
- title_done: initialize COLOUR_INDEX to #$00
- write_colourStart: turn off the highlight and set the y index to #$00
- write_colourName: print characters on the screen (title and select menus option)
- write_done: increment COLOUR_INDEX and load COLOUR_INDEX value to the accumulator. When COLUR_INDEX is not #$10, go to the subroutine write_colourStart
- select_colour
- toggle_highlight: when the value of COLOUR and COLOUR_INDEX are same, highlight it
- highlight: ora #$80

### 3. What I have learned from this lab
It was hard to figure out how should I treat the string in assembly language. Thinking about the logic for this lab was simple but figuring out the way of using ROM, input and output key, and highlight the characters took a long time. It was fun but also overwhelming.
