There are 2 representative errors in programming

1. Compile error
- Prevent a program compile
- Inaccuracy in code
- ex)Syntax error: Grammartically incorrect
- ex)Semantic error (Logic error): Program can run but the result is not what developer want

2. Runtime error
- Error which happens while the program is running
- Hard to track down
- ex) Division by zero, type error
