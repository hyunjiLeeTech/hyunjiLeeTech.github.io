### Introduction
In this posting, I will describe a design and implementation for option 1, lab 4: Adding Calculator. There is a previous posting to describe a code for [option 4: Screen Colour Selector][lab4-option4].

#### Option 1: Adding Calculator
1) Create a subroutine which enables the user to enter two numbers of up to two digits. Indicate where the cursor is, and allow the user to use the digit keys (0-9), backspace, and enter keys. Return the user's input value in the accumulator (A) register.
2) Using this subroutine, write a program which adds the two numbers (each of which is in the range 0-99) and print the result.

The detailed instruction for this lab is demonstrated [here][lab4-instruction].

### 1. Design
#### 1.1. Pseudo Code
1) Store "Enter the first number", "Enter the second number", "result" to output on the screen
2) Print the "Enter the first number: "
3) Receive the first number from the user. User can use enter to store the number and backspace to erase a number
4) Store the received first number from the user
5) Print the "Enter the second number: "
6) Receive the second number from the user. The user can use enter to store the number and backspace to erase the number.
7) Store the received second number from the user
8) Print a string "Result: "
9) Print the result
10) Goes back to the second step

#### 1.2. Variables
1) variables for screen input/output
```
define  SCINIT  $ff81 ; initialize/clear screen
define  CHRIN  $ffcf ; input character from keyboard
define  CHROUT  $ffd2 ; output character to screen
define  SCREEN  $ffed ; get screen size
define  PLOT    $fff0 ; get/set cursor coordinates
```
2) variables for key 
```
define RIGHT  $81
define LEFT  $83
define ENTER  $0d
define BACKSPACE $08
```
3) variables for Numbers that user input 
```
define NUM1    $15;
define  NUM2    $16;
```

#### 1.3. Subroutines
* mainLoop: main looping for the steps described in the psuedo code
* receiveNum: initialize index x to #$15. This place is the start point of output the received number on the screen
* receiveNum_loop: waiting for inputting value
* charCheck: check the inputted value. 

    * If it is backspace, it erases the #$15 digit. 
    * If it is the right arrow, it goes to the first digit
    * If it is the left arrow, it goes to the second digit
    * If it is the enter, it goes to the next process

* drawNum: if the user enters number (#$30 - #$39), it stores the value. If there are already 2 digits received, the second digit will be changed
* move_back: it will be executed when the user enters the backspace
* move_left: it will be executed when the user enters the left arrow
* move_right: it will be executed when the user enters the right arrow
* move: it will be executed when the user enters 
firstNum_store: store the first number the user inputs
* secNum_store: store the second number the user inputs
* result_print: add the first number with the second number and goes to the outputAddition subroutine
outputAddition: add #$30 to convert into ASCII format
* firstNumPrint: print "ENTER FIRST NUMBER: 00"
secNumPrint: print "ENTER SECOND NUMBER: 00"
* resultPrint: print "RESULT: "
goback_main: to go back to the mainLoop subroutine. It will be used in the firstNumPrint, secNumPrint, resultPrint subroutines

### 2. Implementation

### 3. What I have learned from this lab
I have a lot of difficulties to do this lab. The process about getting the value from the user, store the received value into the register to use and output the result are still confusing. I should spend more time to learn how to handle the string in the 6502 assembler.
